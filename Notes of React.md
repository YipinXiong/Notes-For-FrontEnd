# Notes of React 



## JSX

It looks like HTML and can be placed in JS code. Determines the content of our React app just like normal HTML.

##  React vs ReactDOM

React is split into two separate libraries.

`React` knows what a component us and how to make components work together

`ReactDOM` knows how to take a component and make it show up in the DOM.
